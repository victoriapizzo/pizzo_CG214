            <p> <span class="Name"> Mood Lighting </span> installs easily into any and every room of your home. This technology uses finger scanning technology instead of a lightswitch to test your body temperature and figure out your mood.  </p>

        <h2> The Process</h2>
        <div class="process">    
            
            <p> Our new technology uses heat sensing glass to analyze what you are feeling. The lights turn on and adjust to the correct color temperature to create a balancing ambiance. When the technology senses that you are happy, calm, etc., the color temperature will remain mellow and keep you feeling good. When it senses that you are sad, angry, etc., the lighting intesifies and the color temperature changes in a way to create a calming atmosphere in your home and actually change your mood.
            </p>

        <h2> Installation </h2>
        <div class="installation">
            
           <p>Systems can link between rooms so that each room has the same color temperature, or you can choose to separate the rooms so that each room can have a different color temperature if there are different people in different rooms.
            <br>
            Installation is a one time fee, and we offer many different lighting fixtures and bulbs. We come in and do everything for you! The finger scanner is installed where a light switch would be, and the lighting fixtures can be set up as usual.</p>

        <h2> The Creators </h2>
        <div class="creators">
        
            <p> <span class="Name"> Mood Lighting </span> is created by three college psychology students, aiming to make the home a more peaceful place. Candace Wheeler, 24, Timothy Green, 25, and Grace Vanderwaal, 23, are all obtaining their PhD's in psychology and began researching this technology as part of a project aiming to reduce depression rates in a natural way. The three originally tested the idea on patients, and then began to market it to the general public.  </p>
