            <h3> Description </h3>
                <p> Solace is an interactive video narrating the story of a boy who becomes obsessed with the endless flavor combination possibilites of a soda. The website allows the viewer to interact with the animations as a voice narrates the story. Using the mouse, the viewer can pop bubbles and shake the figures on the screen as the story progresses.

            <p> The other websites and projects that I looked at did not keep my attention, and I soon found them boring. Solace was the only one that captured my attention for enough time to really enjoy it. I love how colorful and lighthearted it is, while simultaneously teaching an important lesson. It is fun and interactive while keeping an interesting narrative.</p>
