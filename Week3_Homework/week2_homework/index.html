                <h3 style= "font-family:courier;"> About Him </h3>
                    <p> Salvador Dalí was a surrealist painter from Figueres, Catalonia, Sapin. He is known for his bizzare twist on reality, the most famous of his paintings being "The Persistence of Memory". His work did not only include paintings, though. Dalí was also known for his film, sculpture, and photographic works. Eccentric in both his work and his personal life, Dalí's actions often drew more attention than his work did.

                    <br> In his early life, Dali's parents told him that he was the reincarnation of his brother who passed 9 months before his was born. Dalí believed this and used images of his brother in many of his works. His parents encouraged his art from a young age, building him a studio and sending him to prestigious art schools in Spain. Dalí was not a serious student though, and did not become serious about art until finding modern painting on a trip to Cadaques. Later, after the death of his mother, he attended the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando, where he experimented with Cubism and Dada art. He was later expelled from the school for criticizing his teachers and causing students to riot over the professors. Without this institution, though, Dalí would not have found his inspiration in surrealism.

                <h3 style= "font-family:courier;">Why I Love Dalí</h3>
                    <p> There are many reasons I find Dalí to be an inspiration of mine. For example, his use of symbolism in his art work is quite interesting. I have always loved to find common motifs that artists use, and Dalí generally has at least one in each of his works. 
                    <br> <br> <em> Some symbols that Dalí uses are:</em></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Ants </li>
                            <li> Snails </li>
                            <li> Elephants </li>
                            <li> Angels </li>
                            <li> Eggs </li>
                            <li> Clocks </li>
                            <li> Landscapes </li>
                        </ul>
                <p> His style is also so unique, which inspires me. I love surrealism and try to work it into my photos whenever I can. </p>
