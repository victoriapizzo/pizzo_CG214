            <h1> About Me! </h1> 
            <p> My name is Victoria Pizzo, and I'm from Marlboro, New Jersey. I am a second semester <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pizzophotography/"target=_blank>photography</a> student with a minor in English. Growing up, I always loved stealing cameras away from the grown ups, but I didn't find my love for photography until my sophomore year of highschool.</p>

               <h3> Family </h3>
                    <p> I grew up in a relatively big family; I am the youngest of five kids with the oldest being twelve years older than me. We all have very different personalities, but growing up together was fun because I always had someone to be with.

                        I also have the most perfect dog in the world: Benji. We adopted him when I was in fifth grade, and he is my best friend in the world. 
                    <img src="benji1.png" /> <img src="benji2.png" /> <br> (I had to include two pictures because he's <b><em>so</em></b> perfect.) </p>

                <h3> Work and Hobbies</h3>
                    <p> I started dancing when I was four years old and I grew up with theater as a big part of my life. For the past five summers I worked as the dance counselor of a theater camp, and this will be the first year I do not return. Otherwise, my first job was at a children's party company where I went to people's houses dressed as princesses, mascot characters, pirates, etc. I will embarrass myself by including the link to the Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FairytaleHomeParties/"target=_blank> here.</a> After that, I worked at JCPenny Portrait Studios which I thought would help with my photography (spoiler alert it didn't). I worked there until I came to the wonderful FIT.</p>
