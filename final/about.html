                <p> The first photo Victoria ever took was on a pink Kodak princess camera. Since then she has never looked back. Though it was always an interest of hers, she became serious about photography her sophomore year of high school. <br><br>
                    She enjoys long walks on the beach with her dog Benji, who can often be found eating something he shouldn't be eating. She also has an immense love for food. That's probably why she photographs it so much. <br><br>
                Victoria is currently attending the Fashion Institute of Technology, earning her Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography and Related Media. She is located in New Jersey and New York.
